One key thing I’ve learned so far in the Foundations of Linux and Version Control course is how to navigate and manage files using the Linux command line. Understanding basic commands like cd, ls, mkdir, and rm has helped me interact with the system more efficiently. I’ve also gained valuable skills in version control using Git, including how to track changes, create branches, and collaborate through platforms like GitHub, which is essential for teamwork and managing code in real-world projects.
